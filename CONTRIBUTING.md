## Code Organization: Project and Framework

As a Redwood developer, you're already familiar with the codebase created by `yarn create redwood-app`. In this document, we'll refer to that codebase as a **Redwood Project**.

As a contributor, you'll have to familiarize yourself with one more codebase: the **Redwood Framework**. The Redwood Framework lives in the monorepo [redwoodjs/redwood](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood) (which is where you're probably reading this). It contains all the packages that make Redwood Projects work the way they do. In a Redwood Project, you can find the Redwood Framework in `node_modules/@redwoodjs`.

Here we'll assume your local copy of the Redwood Framework is in a directory called `redwood` and your Redwood Project is in a directory called `redwood-project`.

Chances are that you'll have more than a few VS Codes open when you're contributing—one with the Redwood Framework and one with a Redwood Project at least. An easy way to tell which-is-which is by looking for a red bar at the bottom. The one with a red bar is the Redwood Framework:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32992335/130697522-313317f8-21e5-4f71-8b8e-9690dbad412a.png)

## Local Development Setup

### Redwood Framework

To submit PRs, you will need to Fork the redwoodjs/redwood codebase. You can [do this from GitHub.com or by using GitHub Desktop.](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop#forking-a-repository) Use `git clone` on your fork to get a local copy of the Redwood Framework. If you've already got a local copy, make sure you've got the `main` branch's latest changes using `git pull`. Then run `yarn install` in the root directory to install the dependencies:

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username below:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/your-username/redwood.git
cd redwood
npm i -g corepack
yarn install
```

### Redwood Project: Setup Options

You'll almost always want to test the functionality of your changes to the Redwood Framework in a Redwood Project. When it comes to getting a Redwood Project to test your changes out in, you have several options:

- [***Recommended for 90% of cases***] Create a functional test project. See section below for steps.
- Run `yarn create redwood-app <project directory>`
- `git clone` the [RedwoodJS Tutorial Blog](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood-tutorial)
- Use a project you've already created

**Using the functional test project might be the fastest and easiest way to test your changes.**

#### Redwood Functional Test Project

Run `yarn run build:test-project ../redwood-project` from the root of your local copy of the Redwood Framework to create a functional test project. In just a few minutes, this will create a Redwood Project on the current canary (optionally: `latest` stable) that contains a lot of functionality. For example, here's a brief overview of all the things `yarn run build:test-project <project directory>` does:

1. It installs using the `create-redwood-app` template in the current branch of your Redwood Framework
2. It uses the current `canary` version of Redwood Packages (with the option to use the `latest` stable version)
3. It has a TypeScript language target (with the option for JavaScript)
4. It applies code mods from the [Redwood tutorial](https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial) to add functionality and styling
5. It initializes a Prisma DB migration for SQLite

Unless you've already got a project with a lot of functionality, it'd take quite some effort to add all of this yourself. Moreover, testing your changes in a project that has a lot of functionality will increase your confidence in the changes you're making.

But how do you actually test your changes in the Redwood Framework in your Redwood Project? With another command, this time in the root of your Redwood Project: `yarn rwfw`.

**Test Project CLI Options:**

> Besides `<project directory>`, `build:test-project` takes a few other options as well:

### Testing the Framework in Your Project

As you make changes to the Redwood Framework, you'll want to see your changes reflected "live" in a Redwood Project. Since we're always looking for ways to make contributing to Redwood easier, there are a few workflows we've come up with. The one you'll want to use is `yarn rwfw`.

> `rwfw` is short for Redwood Framework.

The command requires an env var `RWFW_PATH`. Unless you add the env var and value to your shell, the command structure will be `RWFW_PATH=<framework directory> yarn rwfw [option]`.

> Note: On Windows, use `yarn cross-env RWFW_PATH=<framework directory> rwfw [option]`

Navigate to your Redwood Project and run the following, replacing `~/redwood` to match your local path:

```terminal
cd redwood-project
RWFW_PATH=~/redwood yarn rwfw project:sync
```

Where `~/redwood` is the path to your local copy of the Redwood Framework. Once provided to `rwfw`, it'll remember it and you shouldn't have to provide it again unless you move it.

As `project:sync` starts up, it'll start logging to the console. In order, it:

1. cleans and builds the framework
2. copies the framework's dependencies to your project
3. runs `yarn install` in your project
4. copies over the framework's packages to your project
5. waits for changes

Step two is the only explicit change you'll see to your project. You'll see that a ton of packages have been added to your project's root `package.json`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32992335/130699570-6ceb91a6-58aa-4cbf-a080-9cee6f26aaf2.png)

This is all the packages in the Redwood Framework. It's a lot! But don't worry, this'll be cleaned up when you exit the `yarn rwfw project:sync` command.

Congratulations, you're all setup! Any changes you make in the Redwood Framework should be reflected in your Redwood Project.

### Testing the CLI in Your Project

While you can test the CLI using `yarn rwfw`, there's an easier way.

If you've made build or design time changes to RedwoodJS—that is, if you've modified one of the following packages:

- api-server
- cli
- core
- eslint-config
- internal
- prerender
- structure
- testing

You can run a development version of the CLI directly from your local copy of the Redwood Framework. You don't even have to sync any dependencies or files!

> For all the packages above, the entry point is the CLI. They're what we consider "build time" and "design time" packages, rather than "run-time" packages (which are web, auth, api, and forms).

To do that, use the `--cwd` option to set the current working directory to your Redwood Project:

```terminal
cd redwood
yarn build
cd packages/cli
yarn dev <cli command> --cwd <project directory>
```

`yarn dev` runs the CLI and `--cwd` makes the command run in your Redwood Project. If you make a change to the code, remember to rebuild the packages!

> Tips:
>
> - You can use `yarn build:watch` to automatically build the framework whilst you're making changes.
> - `--cwd` is optional, it will reference the `__fixtures__/example-todo-main` project in the framework.

## Cloud Developer Environment

You can use the button below to start a developer environment in the cloud and access it through your browser or favourite IDE locally!

This generates a functional test project and links it with the Redwood Framework code in `main`, giving you an easy playground to try out your fixes and contributions.

> Note: if you make changes to the framework, you will need to run `yarn rwfw project:sync` in the terminal, so that your changes are watched and reflected in the test project

## Local QA and Integration Tests

All of these checks are included in Redwood's GitHub PR Continuous Integration (CI) automation. But it's good practice to understand what they do by using them locally too. The E2E tests aren't something we use every time anymore (because it takes a while), but you should learn how to use it because it comes in handy when your code is failing tests on GitHub and you need to diagnose.

### Build, Lint, Test, and Check

Within your Framework directory, use the following tools and commands to test your code:

1. **Build the packages**: `yarn build`
   - to delete all previous build directories: `yarn build:clean`
2. **Syntax and Formatting**: `yarn lint`
   - to fix errors or warnings: `yarn lint:fix`
3. **Run unit tests for each package**: `yarn test`
4. **Check Yarn resolutions and package.json format**: `yarn check`
   - includes yarn dedupe, constraints, and package.json formatter

### E2E Integration Tests

We use Cypress to test the steps in the [tutorial](https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial). You can run this end-to-end (e2e) test locally by running the following in your local copy of the Redwood Framework:

```terminal
yarn e2e
```

This creates a new project using `yarn create redwood-app` in a temporary directory. Once created, it upgrades the project to the most-recent `canary` release, which means it'll use the code that's in the `main` branch. Once upgraded, it starts Cypress.

If you want to run any of the integration tests against an existing project instead of creating a new one, just provide the path to the project:

```terminal
yarn e2e <project directory>
```

In this case, the command will _not_ upgrade the project to the most-recent `canary` release.

> **Windows Not Supported:** The command for this is written in bash and will not work on Windows.

## Troubleshooting Dependencies

Most of the time your contribution to Redwood won't involve adding any new dependencies. But of course it also sometimes will, and there's some gotchas in our CI checks that you should be aware of:

- we have a yarn constraint that fails if it sees a caret in a version (e.g. something like `^2.5.4` isn't allowed)
  - the solution to this is simple: pin the version (e.g. `2.5.4`, without the caret—`yarn constraints --fix` may do this for you)
- we check for duplicate dependencies and fail if we find any
  - the solution to this is also simple: run `yarn dedupe`
- we check that all of our `package.json`s are sorted
  - if you happen to accidentally "unsort" a package.json, fixing this should be easy: run `yarn dlx sort-package-json` in the unsorted workspace

## Yarn v3: Tips and Troubleshooting

### Yarn Commands and Utilities

**`yarn add --interactive`**
Reuse the specified package from other workspaces in the project. Example:

```
yarn workspace create-redwood-app add -i rimraf
```

> Note: Interactivity is enabled by default

For example, if we're using `yarn add` to add a dependency to a workspace (say `packages/codemods`), and we already have that dependency in another workspace (say `packages/api-server`), yarn will ask us if we want to use the same version:

```
redwood/packages/codemods$ yarn add yargs
? Which range do you want to use? …
❯ Reuse yargs@16.2.0 (originally used by @redwoodjs/api-server@0.37.2 and 2 others)
  Use yargs@^17.2.1 (resolved from latest)
```

**`yarn workspaces foreach ...`**
This is a command from the workspaces plugin. Runs the command across all workspaces. Example:

```
yarn workspaces foreach -i  -v some-package
```

-v: outputs the package name the command is currently running against

### Added to CI: dedupe and constraints

**`yarn dedupe --check`**

> Duplicates are defined as descriptors with overlapping ranges being resolved and
> locked to different locators. They are a natural consequence of Yarn's
> deterministic installs, but they can sometimes pile up and unnecessarily
> increase the size of your project.
> This command dedupes dependencies in the current project using different
> strategies (only one is implemented at the moment).

**`yarn constraints`**
See new file `constraints.pro` for repo config

- [Yarn Constraints](https://yarnpkg.com/features/constraints)
- Reference from Babel project: https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/main/constraints.pro

#### New Files

Yarn `v3` keeps more of itself in the repo than before.
For example, yarn `v3` isn't installed globally, but on a per-project basis.

Here's a quick overview of some of the new yarn-related files in this repo:

| File             | Description                                                          |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.yarnrc.yml`    | Yarn's configuration file                                            |
| `.yarn/plugins`  | Where installed [plugins](https://yarnpkg.com/features/plugins) live |
| `.yarn/releases` | The `yarn v3` binaries themselves                                    |

#### Advanced Cases

If needed, there's more information in [this PR #3154 comment](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/pull/3154#issue-957115489) about special cases:

- "Binary hoisting" is no longer allowed
- Specifying Yarn v1 binary (when necessary)
- `yarn dlx`
- Set `YARN_IGNORE_PATH=1` to ignore local yarn version settings
- how "postinstall" script works

# Creating a Reproduction to Include with Issues

Are you about to open an issue? Including a reproduction, either as a series of steps, as a public GitHub repo, or as a Gitpod snapshot, will definitely let us help you faster!

## Option 1: Create a Gitpod Snapshot

This is a great option when the issue you're reporting is cross-platform. I.e., it isn't a Windows-specific issue. Here's a video walkthrough on how to create a snapshot of the [Redwood-Gitpod starter repo](https://github.com/redwoodjs/starter):

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1521877/176033049-d3c57b92-3ee6-4c60-918b-fdbcfa83fd0f.mp4

## Option 2: Fork the Starter Repo

You can always fork the [Redwood-Gitpod starter repo](https://github.com/redwoodjs/starter) which is a brand new project with the latest stable version of Redwood.
Once you make your changes in your fork, include the link to your repo in your issue. This'll make it much easier for us to understand what's going on.

# Release Publishing

## Canary publishing

Every time a commit is added to the `main` branch, a `canary` release is automatically published to npm. The most recent `canary` packages can be used in Redwood Project via the following command:

```
yarn rw upgrade --tag canary
```

## Release Candidate publishing

For testing and QA purposes, Release Candidates (RCs) will be published prior to a GA release. The process is (will be) automated:

1. A release branch is created from `main`, e.g. `release/minor/v1.2.0`
2. Once published, any commits to the release branch will trigger automatic publishing of an RC, e.g. `v1.2.0-rc.1`

The most recent RC packages can be used in Redwood Projects via the following command:

```
yarn rw upgrade --tag rc
```

## Publishing New Versions: `@latest`

See https://github.com/redwoodjs/release-tooling.
